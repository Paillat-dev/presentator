# How it works
- The bot sends a request to the openai api with the given subject and indications in the marp markdown format
- We extract the images from the markdown and send them to the image generation api
- We generate the pdf and html files from the markdown
- We send the pdf and html files to the user

pip install fastapi
```
- In the file `.env`, set the `USE_IMAGES` variable to `sd`
### With DALLÂ·E 2 (costs dalle credits)
